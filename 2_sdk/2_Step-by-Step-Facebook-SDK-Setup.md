##Step-by-Step: Facebook SDK Setup {#step-by-step}

###1. Facebook App ID {#app-id}

You need a Facebook App ID to use the Facebook SDK for iOS, Android or JavaScript (Web). You can use an [existing app](/apps) if you already have one. Otherwise use our [Quick Start](/quickstarts) to create a new app. If you need help follow our how-to [Register and Configure an App](/docs/apps/register).

###2. Link Ad Accounts

To measure installs in the [Facebook Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager) you have to associate [advertising accounts](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/account/settings/) with your app using the app dashboard. 

1. Go to the [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)
2. Choose your app.
3. Navigate to "Settings > Advanced" and add accounts via the `Authorized Ad Account IDs` input field.
